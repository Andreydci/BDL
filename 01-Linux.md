# What is Linux?

Created in 1991, by Linus Torvalds, as a hobby project to play videogames.

Linux is not an operating system but a Kernel.
A system consists of alot of programs.

  - That is the main program that runs on your system.
  - First and the last program that runs on your computer.
  - The kernel talks to your hardware (Graphics, Disk, Mouse)
  - The kernel make different hardware accesible under a unified interface (drivers)
    So that programs running on the kerne dont have to know the details of the hardware.
  - Offers services the other programs all use (like networking, filesystems)

# How does it relate to other operating systems?
Opposed to Windows, and partly OSX, Linux is free and fully open source. Meaning that
everyone should be able to modify and use it. It's published under the GNU General
Public License. The GPL is one of the most aggressive open-source licenses there is.
Aggressive meaning that it's like a virus. If you make a change to a GPL licensed program,
you have to share it under the GPL license.

# What is the philosophy behind it?
Give users and developers the freedom to personalize their computers, make changes,
fix bugs. Give you total control over the system. Kind of similar to the idea of the Bill of Rights.

# What is a Linux Distribution
A collection of programs around the Linux Kernel. Often distributions come with their own 
individual choice of programs and user interface.

- Ubuntu (were using this one) => debian based
- Fedora
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- CentOS

# What are the advantages
 - Freedom!!!
 - Stability
 - Break!!!
